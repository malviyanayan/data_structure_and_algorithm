Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal

Given preorder and inorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.
Binary Tree Level Order Traversal

Perform a level order traversal of a binary tree (breadth-first traversal).
Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.
Validate Binary Search Tree

Determine if a given binary tree is a valid binary search tree (BST).
Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

Find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes in a binary tree.
Binary Tree Right Side View

Given a binary tree, return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from right to left.
Symmetric Tree

Check whether a binary tree is symmetric (i.e., a mirror of itself).
Path Sum

Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.
Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List

Flatten a binary tree into a "linked list" in place using right pointers to represent the list.
Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal

Perform a zigzag (alternating left-to-right and right-to-left) level order traversal of a binary tree.
Count Complete Tree Nodes

Given the root of a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes efficiently.
Find All the Paths in a Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, return all root-to-leaf paths as a list of strings.
Diameter of a Binary Tree

Find the diameter (longest path between two nodes) of a binary tree.
Sum of Left Leaves

Given a binary tree, find the sum of all left leaves.
Construct Binary Tree from Postorder and Inorder Traversal
